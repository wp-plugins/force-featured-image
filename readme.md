## Installation ##

1. Upload `force-featured-image` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. This plugin lets you specify which post-type requires to force a featured image to. It will also let you specify minimum dimensions for the image.
Let's say, for example, you want to force a user to set an image on the default post type with the following dimensions (400px * 400px). Put this code in the function.php of your theme :
```php
	function theme_force_featured_image( $options ){
		$options['post'] = array(
			'width'  => 400,
			'height' => 400,
		);

		return $options;
	}
	add_filter( 'force_featured_image_post_type', 'theme_force_featured_image' );
```
